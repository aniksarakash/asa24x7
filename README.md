1. For this assignment you should write a program which simulates the
computation performed by a Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA). The
program should be parameterrized (or modular) with respect to the actual
DFA simulated; i.e., it should be possible for you to configure the program
with the description of particular DFA and then run that DFA on several
inputs.

2. Consider the strings on {a, b} defined by the requirements below. For
each, construct an accepting DFA.
a) All strings with exactly one ‘a’.
b) All strings with atleast one ‘a’.
c) All strings with no more than three ‘a’s.
d) All strings with atleast one ‘a’ and exactly two ‘b’s.
e) All strings with exactly two ‘a’s and more than two ‘b’s.
